# The Fluffy2.0 Repository
Fluffy2.0 is a repository for a software system developed for the Sole Trader business, Fluffy's Sweet Treats. The software will focus on Order, Inventory and Customer Management for the business. 
Additionally, this project is related to COMP2171, a course offered by The University of the West Indies.

# Background on Fluffy's Sweet Treats
Fluffyâ€™s Sweet Treats was started by Marcelle Reid in 2016. She operates in Kingston, Jamaica, and primarily specializes in cakes for her clients. Her clients request orders through Instagram, WhatsApp, or by Email.

Currently, she utilises multiple devices to keep track of her orders; such as her phone for confirmation of deposits and ingredients currently in stock, and Microsoft Excel
for specific requirements and prices for an order. She expressed that a system that would allow her to have all details in one place would be best suited for her business.
